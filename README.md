# Bottle_Classification_Model
This project is a deep learning-based bottle classification model that identifies different types of bottles using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset consists of 25,000 images across five categories: Beer Bottles, Plastic Bottles, Soda Bottles, Water Bottles, and Wine Bottles (5,000 images per class).
